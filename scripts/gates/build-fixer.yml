  2. Run build command
  3. If fails, analyze errors and fix
  4. Retry up to 5 times

  OUTPUT JSON ONLY:
  {
    "success": boolean,
    "errors": [{ "message": string, "file": string, "line": number }],
    "fixed": [{ "error": string, "fix": string }],
    "attempts": number,
    "score": number
  }

  SCORING: Build succeeds = 15, fails = 0
