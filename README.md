# CodeAssist

*Professional software development with AI-powered skills framework*

---

## 📚 What is This?

CodeAssist combines professional development workflows with the Superpowers skills methodology to create a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted software development.

**Version 3.1** introduces the complete **Skills Framework** - a systematic approach to development with mandatory protocols, TDD-validated skills, and intelligent agent coordination. Built on proven methodologies from [@obra's Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) combined with CodeAssist's framework-specific guides for Laravel, Python, JavaScript, and mobile development.

  - 4 Testing Skills (TDD, condition-based waiting, anti-patterns, Playwright MCP)
  - 5 Workflow Skills (git, worktrees, parallel agents, branch finishing, subagent-driven)
  - 2 Safety Skills (database backup, defense-in-depth)
  - 2 Debugging Skills (systematic debugging, root-cause tracing)
  - 3 Meta Skills (writing skills, testing skills, sharing skills)
- **Complete Infrastructure**: Agents, hooks, commands for Claude Code

## 🎯 Skills Framework (v3.1)

CodeAssist includes a complete skills framework with **24 systematic protocols** for professional development:

### 🚀 Quick Skills Installation

Install all 24 skills locally in any project:

```bash
# Clone or download the install script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liauw-media/CodeAssist/main/scripts/install-skills.sh
chmod +x install-skills.sh

# Run installation
./install-skills.sh

# Skills now available in ./.claude/skills/ directory (unified location)
```

### 📚 Skills Breakdown (24 Total)

**Critical Skills (MANDATORY):**
- `using-skills` - Protocol for EVERY task (mandatory first response)
- `database-backup` - MANDATORY before ANY database operation ⚠️

**Core Workflow (8 skills):**
- Brainstorming, writing plans, executing plans, code review, requesting review, receiving review, verification

**Testing (4 skills):**
- Test-driven development, condition-based waiting, testing anti-patterns, **Playwright MCP frontend testing**

**Workflow (5 skills):**
- Git workflow, git worktrees, parallel agents, branch finishing, subagent-driven development

**Safety (2 skills):**
- Database backup (CRITICAL), defense-in-depth validation

**Debugging (2 skills):**
- Systematic debugging, root-cause tracing

**Meta (3 skills):**
- Writing skills, testing skills with subagents, sharing skills

### 🎓 Skills Philosophy

Every task follows this cycle:
1. **Check Skills** - Read skills index, identify relevant protocols
2. **Brainstorm** - Discuss approach before coding
3. **Plan** - Break into discrete tasks
4. **Execute** - One task at a time with verification
5. **Review** - Comprehensive self-review
6. **Verify** - Final checklist before completion

**See**: [Skills Index](skills/README.md) for complete guide with triggers and examples.

### 🔄 Keeping Skills Updated

**CodeAssist includes commands to keep your skills framework current:**

**Check for updates:**
```bash
/check-updates
```
Compares your local skills with the latest GitHub version, reports available updates.

**Update skills:**
```bash
/update-skills
```
Automatically fetches and installs the latest 24 skills to `.claude/skills/`.

**Session start reminder:**
```bash
/session-start
```

## 🛡️ Database Safety (CRITICAL)

**MANDATORY for all projects with databases:**

```bash
# ALWAYS backup before tests:
./scripts/safe-test.sh npm test

# NEVER run tests directly:
npm test  # ❌ WRONG - can wipe production database

# Manual backup before any database operation:
./scripts/backup-database.sh
```

**Why this matters:** We've had 2 incidents where tests wiped production databases without backups. This system prevents that.

**See**: [Database Backup Strategy Guide](docs/database-backup-strategy.md) for complete implementation.
